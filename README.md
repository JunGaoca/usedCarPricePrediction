**Jupyter Notebook with code, experimentation, further insights, and deployment strategies: [here](https://github.com/JunGaoca/usedCarPricePrediction/blob/main/used-car-price-prediction.ipynb).**

## Business Goal
Accurate price assessment is essential in the used-car trading business. This analysis aims to identify key factors affecting used car prices and develop predictive models for price forecasting. These insights will help dealers optimize inventory and pricing strategies to maximize profitability. 

## Data
The original Kaggle dataset of 3 million used cars was reduced to 426,880 entries to enhance processing speed and efficiency. The dataset is [here](https://github.com/JunGaoca/usedCarPricePrediction/blob/main/data/vehicles.csv).

This dataset with 18 features includes:
-   Numeric Features – price, odometer, year
-   Categorical Features – region, manufacturer, model, condition, cylinders, fuel, title_status, transmission, VIN, drive, size, type, paint_color, state
